I feel that our excessive emphasis on cultural identity can be detrimental in the following ways:  1) Students and parents will claim that they are being \"indoctrinated\"; 2) By overemphasizing cultural identities we convey without intent that the individual should be a \"vessel\" for culture.  Students may fail to actualize as individuals that are distinct from their culture or heritage; 3) In the real world, students have to learn to work together and get along with others on the common playing field of secular pragmatism - this is what is ultimately expected by Fortune 500 employers.",

As a younger teacher dealing with students of various cultures, I learned that while I believe looking someone in the eye is respectful, but to others, it may not be. I always write student names phonetically if it is a name I am unfamiliar with; I thought that was a good suggestion. I've also found that knowing a little about your students and their interests goes a long way in establishing a positive relationship, which may improve their comfort level and willingness to experiment with trying different ways to do things.",
